# TechnoLuc's Windows Utility
#### forked from Chris Titus Tech

## Open PowerShell as Administrator
### Launch Command:

```
iwr -useb https://win.technoluc.nl | iex
```

Added: Notion, Termius, Minitool Partition Wizard

Personal favorite: 
Tweaks: ESSENTIAL Cat Bin

I have also added the Microsoft OfficeDeploymentTool. This unpacks some files in C:\Program Files\Office Deployment Tool. 
It also downloads a couple of files;

1) a configuration file for installing OfficeProPlus21, excluding some apps and the preferred language (EN-US). 

2) the install.cmd command that opens the installer and passes the config.xml file to it for an unattended installation and 

3) a script created by ms.guides.com that activates Office 2021. 

I also added the Minitool Partition Wizard (Free) and Notion
